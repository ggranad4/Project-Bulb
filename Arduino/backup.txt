LED to Arduino 
  -Place LED into breadboard
  -Connect LED negative(short pin) with resistor
  -The other end of the resistor is connected to the negatiive side of the breadboard
  -Place a wire for the resistor to connect to the arduino ground
  -Connect LED positive (large pin) to the arduino pin 13
